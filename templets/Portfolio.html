    <p>Hello, my name is Neandra Harris.And I am a robotics and embedded system major. How did I become this major? To be honest, There are a lot of factors in place.Ever since I was little, I was always.Sort of a mixed bag of everything or I could.Do everything from drawing to.But one weird thing that I would do.Is take things apart and make something new out of it.This lead to hobbies such as.Shop class where we created some,bird houses, A lot of art classes.And.Eventually the robotics club after watching Big Hero 6. Something.Trying to bring my creations.Let my clay statues and figurines.And make them move.Intrigued me so much that.Knowing that robotics was an option.I immediately jumped on it.At first.I was a little lost.Within the club.Because people already knew how to code.And pretty much knew what they were doing so kind of felt a little left out.But then.Started playing around with it and eventually I got.Are practice robot to work and that's when I knew this is something that I wanted to do. One thing I will say.Even though I want to do robotics, I want to be able to help people as well, whether it's helping them find a job.Or.Helping them create something.I also have a habit of trying to help out the environment, finding ways to recycle.And try to better myself in fact. To do this I want to create.A creative business where I can take robotics to a whole nother level to help create clean up the planet to help create new and creative jobs to help.a skit to a better future.Just for my short time being here.I was able to create.Inner innovator where it's going to provide.Students away to help each other out.And in the future, I plan to expand on that project to make it more accessible for.People even outside of the school.To help students and.People in general find their purpose. Everybody has a reason to be alive.So giving someone a chance to.Expand on that, trying to find what they're good at and. Working with them.Would be a wonderful opportunity to help bring people together, and hopefully, maybe one day it would be a solution to World Peace. It's a big stretch, but it's a dream.That could be accomplished one step at a time.
